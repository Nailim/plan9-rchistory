# plan9-rchistory

## about

An attempt to bring command history trough keyboard shortcuts to rc shell inside rio window following the philosophy of modularity.

## why

Plan9 was build with with a graphical interface in mind, which allows for some amazing functionality (such as inline editing and execution of previous commands), and should be highly encouraged to try out.

That being said, there are use cases in which a command history functionality and keyboard interface would be useful: repetitive commands (executing same/similar command for testing or scanning, ...), faster recollection of already used commands (between context switches, extended usage sessions, crowded printouts, ...), access to previous commands between terminals and sessions (continuation of used commands trough time between sessions, reboots, ...), ...

But most, in my opinion, important reason: **learning**! The frustration of dealing with the unknown operation of the system (mistyped command, experimentig with flags, pressure of remembering large quantities of information at once, ...) instead of learning the system, can (and will) impede the speed at which the knowledge is acquired or (in worst case) deter from actually pursuing the acquisition of this particular knowledge. In short, its more fun to learn the thing, than to deal with the with the peripheral things needed to learn the thing.

## instalation

### build

`mk`

### install

`mk install`

## usage

For now, run hist command to print out the commands used in this terminal window (we'll call that local history). More to come.

## faq

### why why

Simple, let's learn something. This Plan9 thing is new to me too.

### what is plan9

Good question! I like you, you're trying to figure out something new. Unfortunately outside of the scope of this document. Please use the wast collection of knowledge of the internet to find out (even ChatGPT will be able to give you quite the explanation). To add to the confusion, this was developed on 9front.

### is this for me

In short, probably not. This requires some previous knowledge, and by the time that knowledge is acquired, you'll already have an answer to this question.
